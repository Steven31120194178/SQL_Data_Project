/* Summary for this problem 2:
Start with company_dim table â€” this is your "base" table.

You build a "temporary table" (count_jobs) from your subquery, which aggregates job counts (COUNT(*)) per company_id.

Then you LEFT JOIN the subquery (count_jobs) onto company_dim based on company_id.

Because it's a LEFT JOIN, you keep all rows from company_dim, whether or not a match exists in count_jobs.
